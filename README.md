First of all, I’m sorry for video without sounds. There are some strange problem with them. Program for capture video can’t catch sounds from source and I don’t know why.

This project is an attempt to give a new life to the old game namely Star Control and up my programmer skills with webgl and game dev. More specifically Star Control melee battle, try to create online battle. Unfortunately server side is wrong and horriable so I stopped developing. FirstIy I should read the book something like “Network and online game” or “server side of online game” and rewrite project.

But you can see what realized at this moment in video down.
